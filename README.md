# Summary of what the app does:
This Full Stack app visualizes dispatch data by providing recommendations for how many marshallers are needed during different times of the day. It offers a range of interactive tools that allow users to adjust the data (via a slider increase dispatch amount) and menu dropdown and view different types of graphs (grid table, heatmap, and bar graph). The appâ€™s goal is to help users determine staffing needs based on dispatch patterns, with  visuals that update based on user input.
