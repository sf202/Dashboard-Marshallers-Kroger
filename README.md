# Summary of what the app does:
This Full Stack dashboard  visualizes dispatch data by providing recommendations for how many truck marshallers are needed during different times of the day. It offers a range of interactive tools that allow users to adjust the data and view different types of graphs. The dashboardâ€™s goal is to help management determine staffing needs based on dispatch patterns, with visuals that update based on user input.

* Input: Number of dispatch times via CSV or Excel File .

* Output: Predicted number of marshallers needed per hour.
* Determine the required number of marshallers for each a.m. and p.m. shift. 
*The Solution: Implement a Marshaller Dashboard System to automate scheduling and staffing.
